> `A widespread misconception in much of psychology is that (a) vertebrate animals evolved, “newer” brain structures were added  over existing “older” brain structures, and (b) these newer, more complex structures endowed animals with newer and more complex psychological functions, behavioral flexibility, and language.  This belief, although widely shared in introductory psychology textbooks, has long been discredited among neurobiologists and stands in contrast to the clear and unanimous agreement on these  issues among those studying nervous-system evolution.`
